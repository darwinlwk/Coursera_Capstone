Introduction

Paris. The capital of France, and commonly known as The City of Light & Love. Paris is a very popular European destination for many.
Paris is the global center for finance, fashion, food, arts, architecture and history. There are tons of things to do, lots of food
to enjoy. It is highly recommended to create a travel itinerary in order to prioritize the must-do activities, must-visit sites and
must-try food, while having a balance to explore around.

Paris is quite huge, thus to fully utilise the time spent there, it's highly recommended to plan an itinerary. This project will try to
create an itinerary that saves time while getting the most out of one's trip to Paris, giving some suggestions to see, do and eat in Paris.

The data collected will be useful for future visitors to Paris, helping them to plan their itinerary better.
The data used to come up with this project is found from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris). The latitude
and longtitude are compiled using Nominatim. The locations are found using Foursquare API.
