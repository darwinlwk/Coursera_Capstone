Introduction

- In Singapore, watching movies are Singaporean favourite things to do. No matter what day, what time. If there are some spare time available, watching movies is usually the top choice.
- But in Singapore, with the number of cinemas available, the number of seats available during peak hours for blockbuster movies are always sold out. Which is a hassle to a lot of people who wants to watch movies (e.g. after office hours or dinner time).
- So, what are the locations available that cinemas are not readily available?
- A cinema should be situated near food outlets; different transportation options should be available too.
- Walking distance from transportation shouldn’t really be an issue, but it’s highly recommended to be walking distance.
- My task would be in such small island of Singapore, where would it be ideal to build a brand new cinema, to minimize the amount of sold out tickets at popular locations and peak hours.
